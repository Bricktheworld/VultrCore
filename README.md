# Vultr Game Engine

This is my homebrewed custom game engine. It has support for basic 3D rendering with PBR and a suite of editor features that allow for basic scene editing.

This is NOT meant to create actual games, it is a hobby engine that I made for fun and learning purposes.

Features:
- Custom ECS system
- Hot-reload gameplay DLL
- Move entities around scene
- Scene serialization
- Macro-based reflection system
- STL replacement
- Vulkan 3D rendering backend
- PBR
- Shader hot-reloading
- File browser
- Multi-threaded asset loading system
